**Aleph Hackathon March '25** — Polkadot track

## The Problem

Our mission is to build tools of mass restoration for nature, and we’re kicking things off with a focus on recycling.

We discovered a proven solution that increases recycling rates, reduces litter, and makes a profit: the Deposit Return Scheme. You pay a small deposit when you buy soda, then return the container on the supermarket and get the deposit back. It’s been super successful in Europe, but it relay's reverse vending machines that are expensive and setting them up takes a ton of effort (often dragging in the government).

To solve this problem, we decided to digitize the entire deposit system — no expensive machines, just an app that tracks every container, fights fraud, and makes it feasible for communities and countries from LATAM to adopt a deposit return scheme.

## The hackathon

During the hackathon, we didn't have time to implement code for the solution (as we first decided to go with a different sponsor before the announcement of multiple sponsors), so we focused on presenting the business model, the user flow, and the system architecture. On this file, we describe the architecture that the system would have — not just for the hackathon, but for a real-world scenario.

We are committed to implementing this solution in the real world, so we are looking for the appropiate technology to implement this project at scale. Also, if you want to help us implement a pilot in a small city (or big one!) anywhere in LATAM or beyond, reach out. Let’s protect our planet together!
